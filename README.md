# Code Blocks!

After cloning this repo, run `npm install` or `yarn` to install the dependencies.

Then, use this as `node syntax.js <file to generate codeblocks>`. For now, it outputs 2 files, called output.html and output.png. There is an included file for you to try it out, `test_file.js`. Also, you can do `node syntax.js syntax.js` to generate codeblocks of the source code.

Currently, indentation breaks for space-indented files.
